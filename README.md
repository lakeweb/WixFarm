# WixFarm
This was an exercise in automating the production of a wix product.wxs file for direct compiling by wix without editing the product.wxs. In this project, the file 'project.xml' controls the production of the product.wxs. One of the motivations was to compile a demo version of our product and a release version of the product. This so if the user had installed the demo version, the release version would install over the top of it.

There is more. Like using ISIS for a bootstrap loader......
